Vavehl
======
Note that I'll be adding little demos and tests here - http://jonathanherr.net/UnityGames/

I'll only put source up here once we start building real game parts vs tests and training stuff. 

Workspace for building a game based on Lorin's Vavehl World. 

Javascript objects being built as test using a nodejs server to support standalone development - 
to later be ported to Unity once basic functionality for various parts exist.
